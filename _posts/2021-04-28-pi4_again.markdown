In my previous post, I showed using a similar example why the $\pi=4$ proof above is wrong. Essentially, it boils down to continuity. In this post, I will try to make this a little more rigorous. 

The proof in the comic essentially works by defining a sequence of shapes $\left(\square_{n}\right)\_{n=1}^{\infty}$. $\square_{1}$ is the unit square, which has perimeter $4$. $\square_{2}$ is formed by removing the corners from $\square_{1}$ in way which preserves the perimeter. $\square_{3}$ is formed by removing the corners from $\square_{2}$ in a way which again preserves the perimeter, and so forth. When the comic “repeats to infinity,” it implicitly invokes the notion of limits. That is, letting $\bigcirc$ be the unit circle, we can define some notion of convergence on the space of shapes such that $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\square_{n}=\bigcirc$. And that is fine so far as it goes. No rules have been broken yet.

The sleight of hand in the final panel is to assume that this limit will preserve the perimeter. If we define $p(x)$ to be the perimeter of shape $x$, then $\pi=p\left(\bigcirc\right)$ by definition. The comic implicitly assumes that since, $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\square_{n}=\bigcirc$, it must also be true that $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}p\left(\square_{n}\right)=p\left(\bigcirc\right)$. The proof fails because this is not true. The sequence does indeed satisfy $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}p\left(\square_{n}\right)=4$. But $\pi$ is equal to $p\left(\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\square_{n}\right)$ which is a totally different object.

To formalize this argument, we need to work with metric spaces. In $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ we can work with the standard Euclidean metric: $d_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}(x,y)=\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_{i}-y_{i})^{2}}$. But we also require a metric space of shapes in order to formalize the notion that $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\square_{n}=\bigcirc$. 

To this end, let $X$ be the set of shapes, where a shape is defined as some bounded non-empty subset of $\mathbb{R}^{2}$. For example, $\bigcirc\in X$ and is defined by the set $\\{(a,b)\in\mathbb{R}^{2}:a^{2}+b^{2}=1\\} \subset\mathbb{R}^{2}$. Similarly $\square_{n}\in X$ for each $n$. We can define a distance between two shapes $x,y \in X$ using the [Hausdorf Metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_distance):

$$d_{X}(x,y)=\max\left(\sup_{a\in x}\inf_{b\in y}d_{\mathbb{R}^{2}}\left(a,b\right),\sup_{a\in y}\inf_{b\in x}d_{\mathbb{R}^{2}}\left(a,b\right)\right).$$

In words, we can define the distance between two shapes as follows: First, for each each point in each shape, find the closest point in the other shape. Then use the maximum of all of these point-wise distances to define the distance between the two shapes. The max operation ensures the metric is symmetric. This will help us avoid implying, for example, that the distance between a half circle and a full circle is $0$. We can now define convergence of shapes according to the Hausdorff metric:

**Definition:** $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\square_{n}=\bigcirc$ if and only if for all $\epsilon>0$, there exists a natural number $n$ such that $d_{X}\left(\square_{n},\bigcirc\right)<\epsilon$ whenever $n>N$.

This definition should be satisfied because if we remove enough corners from the square, all points in the new shape should be within $\epsilon$ distance of the unit circle, and therefore the maximum distance over all of the points in the new shape should be less than $\epsilon$ as well. This is evident from the illustrations in the comic.

Now we define the perimeter function, $p:X\mapsto\mathbb{R}$. The proof would be valid if $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}p\left(\square_{n}\right)=p\left(\bigcirc\right):=\pi$. But this is true only if $p$ is a continuous function. In fact, this is one of many valid definitions of a continuous function!

**Definition:** Let $(X,d_{X})$ and $(\mathbb{R},d_{\mathbb{R}})$ be metric spaces, $p:X\mapsto\mathbb{R}$ be a function, and $\bigcirc\in X$. $p$ is *continuous* at $\bigcirc$ if whenever $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\square_{n}=\bigcirc$, we have $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}p\left(\square_{n}\right)=p\left(\bigcirc\right)$.

Since $p\left(\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\square_{n}\right)=p\left(\bigcirc\right)$, continuity essentially tells us when we can interchange limits and functions to get $p\left(\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\square_{n}\right)=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} p\left(\square_{n}\right)$. If a function is not continuous, then we cannot pull the limit out, and that is ultimately why the proof fails. What the comic actually proves is that $p$ is not continuous at the unit circle by way of contradiction.
